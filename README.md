## Cyclistic Bike Share data Analysis Case Study

The following steps were used for the creation of this case study:

1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act

### The task is find the how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently

### My analysis:
1. Most of the users seem be members as they contribute to around 65% of the userbase.
2. We can see in general that Casual users tend to have higher average bike usage durations throughout the analysis.
3. We can notice some seasonality in the data i.e there seems be higher ride durations during the summer months like May, June, July, August.
4. Also the usage is much lower in winter and holiday seasons like Nov, Dec, Jan.
5. There is also a drastic drop in ride duration by members in the winter months.
6. The average ride durations for both Casual and members seem to be similir with the durations being much higher during the weekends.
7. But we can observe that the members seem to be using the bikes on weekdays, so they could be using the bikes for commuting to work.
8. In contrast the casual users use the bikes more during the weekends probably for leisure riding.
